# crontest
very simple test to understand how to schedule cron jobs on a website

you can find the working test here:
http://tko.rf.gd/crontest.php
the date is updated every 24 hours
the cron job is scheduled directly on the control panel app from InfinityFree hosting service.
(note that the free hosting can only allow for max 5s cron jobs, so this would not be good for planned data scraping)
